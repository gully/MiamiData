City of Miami Open Data

I made this IPython Notebook as a demonstation of what one can do with the City of Miami Open Data Portal.  This work was done at the Code for Miami Weekly Civic Hack Night on Monday June 29, 2015.  Thanks to The LAB Miami for hosting the event.

There are many caveats and provisos to the result of the analysis.  Notably, I censored some of the data that had missing values when calculating the fraction of the time 311 meets their goals, so take the analysis with a grain of salt.  This analysis is mostly intended as a demonstration of Open Data.
